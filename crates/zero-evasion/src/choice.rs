//! Which way to hide a server name, picked per server from what happened on
//! the last connections to it.
//!
//! There are three ways of hiding a name from a socket without root: the
//! urgent byte ([`crate::urgent`]), TCP Fast Open (the hello rides in the
//! SYN, `zero_net::fastopen`) and the decoy ([`crate::decoy`]). They cost
//! very different amounts:
//!
//! * the urgent byte costs nothing: one extra byte, no wait;
//! * Fast Open costs nothing either (it saves a round trip) once the
//!   kernel holds the server's cookie; the first connection to a server only
//!   fetches that cookie;
//! * the decoy costs every connection one round trip and a bit more, because
//!   the real hello only leaves once the server has said it is missing (about
//!   0.33 s per connection measured from Tehran, against 0.35 s for the whole
//!   plain handshake).
//!
//! But they do not get past the same things. Some servers read the urgent
//! byte badly: the handshake completes and then the server never answers
//! again. Some servers do not do Fast Open, and some paths drop a SYN that
//! carries data. So the rule here is "the free ways first, the decoy where
//! they have been seen to fail", one rung at a time:
//!
//! ```text
//! connection to 1.2.3.4:443   urgent byte → answered twice → stays urgent
//! connection to 5.6.7.8:443   urgent byte → went silent    → 1 strike
//! connection to 5.6.7.8:443   urgent byte → went silent    → 2 strikes:
//!                             Fast Open for this server for the next 10 minutes
//! connection to 5.6.7.8:443   Fast Open   → went silent    → 1, then 2 strikes:
//!                             the decoy for the next 10 minutes
//! ```
//!
//! A connection is *answered* when the server replied to the client's second
//! flight, not just to the first: that is the point the bad case stops at
//! (handshake done, nothing after). It *went silent* when it waited
//! [`SILENT_AFTER`] for a reply, or was dropped while waiting. Anything else
//! (dropped right after a reply, before the client wrote again) says nothing
//! and is not counted. The wait is timed so a stuck connection counts while
//! the user is still looking at it, not only once something gives up on it.
//!
//! Two strikes in a row, and a strike is wiped by any answered connection, so
//! one page the user closed early does not move a server to the slow way.
//! After [`DECOY_FOR`] the server gets the cheap way again: filters and
//! servers change, and the cheap way is worth a new try. The table holds at
//! most [`MAX_SERVERS`] servers; the oldest are forgotten first.
