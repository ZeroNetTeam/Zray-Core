//! A pool of allow-listed server names for the SNI decoy.
//!
//! Iran's filter decides to throttle or let a TLS connection through largely
//! from the server name it reads out of the ClientHello, so the decoy hello
//! ([`crate::decoy`]) carries a name the filter is known to let through rather
//! than the real one. Up to now that name was a single hard-coded host,
//! `www.speedtest.net`. One name is a single point of failure: the day the
//! filter starts throttling or blocking it, every decoy that uses it fails at
//! once, and nothing in the field can route around it.
//!
//! This module holds a small, curated set of such names instead and hands out
//! one per server. Two properties matter:
//!
//! * **Stable per server.** [`pick`] maps a server to the same name every
//!   time, so a connection does not flap between names from one dial to the
//!   next — a censor watching one flow sees one steady decoy name, and the
//!   balancer's verdict about whether the decoy gets through stays meaningful.
//! * **Spread across servers.** Different servers draw different names, so a
//!   censor cannot kill every Zray decoy by throttling one host, and a name
//!   that stops working on one network only costs the servers that drew it.
//!
//! The trade-off: only `www.speedtest.net` is measured un-throttled from
//! inside Iran (Xray-core #3318); the rest are reasoned candidates — national
//! payment, operator and super-app domains a censor is unlikely to throttle
//! because doing so breaks commerce, and global speed-test hosts that tend to
//! be left alone. A pick that a given network does throttle is not a dead end:
//! the decoy is always one balancer-probed variant among others, and
//! [`crate::choice`] falls back to the urgent byte or a plain hello when it
//! does not get through, so a bad pick loses a probe and nothing more.
//!
//! Every name here is a real site, so a censor that actively probes the decoy
//! finds one, and every name is a plain host of visible ASCII within the
//! injector's 1..=219-byte bound (see the tests), so it is a legal `fake_sni`.
//!
//! Where the names come from, so the set can be refreshed by hand: the
//! speed-test hosts are the ones the circumvention community cites as
//! un-throttled; the Iranian hosts are the largest public super-app, payment,
//! operator, bank and CDN domains (the kind collected in
//! `bootmortis/iran-hosted-domains` and `v2fly/domain-list-community`'s
//! `category-ir`).
//!
//! A signed, remotely-updatable list extends this set at runtime without an
//! app update, so a name the filter starts throttling can be diluted by fresh
//! ones the day it happens: `zero_discovery::domestic_feed` fetches and
//! signature-checks the list, [`parse_feed`] turns the body into extra names,
//! and [`pick_from`] draws from the bundled pool and the fetched names
//! together. The feed only ever adds — the bundled set is the offline floor
//! that always works with no network, the names a fetched line is checked
//! against for duplicates, and the home of the one measured-good host.
