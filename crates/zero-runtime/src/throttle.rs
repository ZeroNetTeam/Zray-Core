//! A rate limit on what is read from a stream, for the traffic of clients
//! that have not proved who they are.
//!
//! How this works. [`Throttle`] wraps a stream and counts what is read from
//! it. The first `after_bytes` pass untouched, so a real browser-sized
//! exchange with the camouflage site looks normal; beyond that the stream is
//! held to `bytes_per_sec`, with `burst` bytes of credit that refills over
//! time (a token bucket). Writes pass straight through: the limit belongs to
//! the direction the wrapped stream is *read* in, so wrapping the client
//! limits its uploads and wrapping the target limits its downloads.
//!
//! The rule it keeps: a limit of zero is no limit, and a throttled read
//! always makes progress (at least one byte per refill tick), so a stream is
//! slowed, never stuck.
