//! `buildConfig`: the app's settings screen, turned into a runtime config.
//!
//! The app never writes Xray JSON itself. It sends a small `BuildRequest`
//! (links, mode, a few toggles) and gets back a complete configuration built
//! on [`zero_config::IranPreset`] — the same preset the desktop tools use, so
//! the routing, DNS tiers and sanction handling are identical everywhere —
//! with the mobile specifics layered on:
//!
//! * a `tun` inbound whose addresses match what the app gives
//!   `VpnService.Builder`, and a `dns` outbound that answers the tunnel's
//!   UDP/53 from the runtime's own resolver (see `zero_runtime::dns_out`);
//! * one outbound per link (`proxy`, `proxy-1`, …) and, with more than one, a
//!   `leastPing` balancer fed by the observatory, so a dying server is routed
//!   around in-process;
//! * the LAN-sharing, QUIC-blocking and evasion toggles.
//!
//! The result is compiled with `zero_config::compile_config` before it is
//! returned: a config that would not start is reported as an error here, where
//! the app can show it, rather than as a failed `start`.
//!
//! **FakeDNS** (`dns.fakedns`, VPN mode only): a catch-all `fakedns` server
//! goes in front of the encrypted remote tier, so an application's query for
//! a foreign name is answered at once with a synthetic 198.18.0.0/15 address
//! and the name itself travels to the proxy, which resolves it on the far
//! side: no DNS round trip through the tunnel before every new site, and no
//! answer for a filtered resolver to poison. Domain-scoped tiers (domestic
//! names, sanctioned names) still get real answers, so direct routing by
//! address keeps working. The runtime answers only the applications from
//! FakeDNS; its own lookups (proxy server names, direct connections) use a
//! view of the resolver without it (`zero_dns::Resolver::without_fake`).
