//! The signed, remotely-updatable domestic-SNI decoy list.
//!
//! The SNI decoy ([`zero_evasion::decoy`]) carries a server name the Iranian
//! filter is known to let through in place of the real one, drawn from a
//! curated pool ([`zero_evasion::domestic`]). That pool is compiled into the
//! app, which makes it the one thing in the decoy path that cannot change
//! without shipping a new build: the day the filter starts throttling a name
//! in it, every device is stuck with the old set until it updates.
//!
//! This module is the escape hatch. The maintainer publishes a short list of
//! extra decoy names on the `crowd-data` branch — `domestic-sni.txt`, one host
//! per line — signed with the same key as `verified.txt` ([`crate::sign`]).
//! The app fetches it over the same metered, filtered link as every other
//! feed ([`crate::feed`]), so the three guarantees there apply unchanged:
//!
//! * **Verified.** A freshly downloaded body is refused unless it matches the
//!   detached `domestic-sni.txt.sig` signature, so a CDN or a network in the
//!   middle cannot inject a name the filter *does* throttle (which would be a
//!   way to mark Zray's traffic rather than hide it).
//! * **Mirrored.** jsDelivr is the primary and GitHub raw the fallback, since
//!   the two are filtered at different times in Iran.
//! * **Cached, with an offline floor.** The last good list is kept on disk; a
//!   failed fetch leaves it in place, and a device that has never reached the
//!   list falls back to the bundled pool — [`cached`] returns nothing and the
//!   pick ([`zero_evasion::domestic::pick_from`]) uses the compiled-in names
//!   alone. The feed only ever *adds*, so it can never leave the decoy worse
//!   off than a build with no network at all.
//!
//! The list is small on purpose (a handful of names, capped by
//! [`zero_evasion::domestic::MAX_FEED_NAMES`]): a decoy pool wants a few good
//! hosts, not a directory, and a hostile but somehow-signed body still cannot
//! make a device hold more than the cap.
